```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(tidytext)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
coffee_ratings <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/coffee_ratings.csv')
```

```{r}
coffee_ratings %>% 
  group_by(country_of_origin) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cupper_points, country_of_origin, color = species))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5)
```


```{r}
coffee_longer <- coffee_ratings %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(aroma:sweetness, "moisture"), names_to = "rating_cat", values_to = "rating")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggbeeswarm)

coffee_longer %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rating, rating_cat, color = species))+
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5)
```
